Nmap network scanning task work to identify open ports and analyze security risks
This repository contains the documentation and output files related to the network port scanning task performed using the Nmap tool.
Overview
The objective of this task was to discover open ports on devices within a local network to understand the network exposure and potential security risks. The scan was executed using Nmap's TCP SYN scan on the local subnet.
Contents
•	Task worksheet PDF: Detailed task instructions and guidelines.
•	Scan outputs: Nmap command outputs with redacted sensitive data.
•	Documentation: Research on common services running on identified open ports and their associated security risks.
Tools Used
•	Nmap: The Network Mapper, used for network discovery and security auditing.
•	Optional tools for packet analysis such as Wireshark (not included in this repository).
Highlights
•	Identified active hosts and their open TCP ports.
•	Detailed analysis of common services associated with those ports.
•	Identification of potential vulnerabilities linked to open ports.
•	Documentation includes recommended best practices for secure network administration.
How to Use
You can review the worksheet and documentation to understand the methodology and findings. The outputs show practical usage of Nmap for network reconnaissance valuable in network security assessments.
